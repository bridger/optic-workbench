- Draw the lens with curved surface
√ Have a parabolic mirror
- Lenslet array
- Different colors for the rays
- Profile for performance (turn of anti-aliasing?)
√ Drag offset
√ If an off-screen ray would intersect the rectangle again, draw it
- Resizing the window doesn't reposition the focal length indicators
